# Floors under the things a deletion makes smaller. Nothing else in CI
# notices a test that disappears: the suite passes with fewer cases, the
# xcresult reports fewer, and the badge simply reads a smaller total. A
# README claim whose marker is removed stops being checked by
# check_readme_claims.sh, which only looks at markers that are still there.
#
# These are floors, not ratchets. Adding a test needs no edit here -- except
# when the new tests are the whole of a change's guard, in which case leaving
# the floor where it was means every guard the change contributes can be
# deleted and no gate notices. Raise it past them in the same commit.
# Removing a test needs an edit here as well, in the commit that removes it,
# where it can be argued for.

# 248 -> 243 when the key file's name and its healing moved into the binding
# (modelpipe-ffi 0.4.0): six cases went down with them, and the status a
# pairing refusal now carries brought one back. What is left here is what this
# side still owes, which is the directory. The claims are not weaker, they are
# made one layer down, against the code that does the work.
#
# 243 -> 246 for the three guards that hold this change's silent failures to
# account: the key file's name, the discard-and-retry that heals one this
# device cannot use, and the name of the directory they all live in. Each is a
# whole guard of its own, so the floor moves past them -- left where it was,
# any of the three could be deleted and no gate would notice, while a rename
# on either side of the boundary orphans every paired device in silence.
#
# 2026-09-23: 246 -> 255, 22 -> 23 and 166 -> 171 for the system prompt. A
# prompt that stops being sent fails nothing else: the request still goes out,
# the reply still streams, and it reads a little less like what was asked for.
# These tests are the whole of its guard -- that it goes ahead of send,
# Continue and Retry but is never kept as a message, that blank sends none,
# that it survives a relaunch, and that the sheet keeps what was saved -- so
# the floors move past every one of them, the README's markers included.
#
# 2026-09-25: 255 -> 257 and 171 -> 173 for the lookup by key. A save or a
# delete asks for the one row with that key. A lookup that ignored its key and
# took the first row would pass any test that keeps one row of its table, and
# in use it would write an edit onto the wrong row or delete the wrong one. Two
# new tests guard it, one per table: twenty providers, and twenty
# conversations, with one of them edited and then deleted. Each fails when its
# table's save or its delete stops asking by key, and for a delete it is the
# only test that does, so the floor moves past both. The README claim names
# both, so the marker floor moves past both markers.
