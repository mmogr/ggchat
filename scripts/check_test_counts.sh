# Floors under the things a deletion makes smaller. Nothing else in CI
# notices a test that disappears: the suite passes with fewer cases, the
# xcresult reports fewer, and the badge simply reads a smaller total. A
# README claim whose marker is removed stops being checked by
# check_readme_claims.sh, which only looks at markers that are still there.
#
# These are floors, not ratchets. Adding a test needs no edit here -- except
# when the new tests are the whole of a change's guard, in which case leaving
# the floor where it was means every guard the change contributes can be
# deleted and no gate notices. Raise it past them in the same commit.
# Removing a test needs an edit here as well, in the commit that removes it,
# where it can be argued for.
